Start.py - Calls all the below functions to complete the project from start to finish

file_control.py - the design of the programs are based on the folders created in this file.

View_data.py - Seperates the data from each day to every bus of each day

mapping.py - Used to see the map generated by the buses location.

Long_Lat_Time.py - Divides the the gps data into bus stops and signals based
		   on how long a bus stays at the same location
	 	   We used less than 30 seconds for bus stops and more than
		   30 seconds for signals.

clustering.py - We use a DBSCAN clustering algorithm to find the bus stops and signals.
		We compared the GPS data of the signals and buses. If any common point is 
		present we removed it from the set of the bus stops to remove false positives
		
		We trained the set manually based on the data of Day1.
		If time was available we could have trained it through a loop across multiple
		days to obtain a more accurate radius value for the clustering algorithm.
